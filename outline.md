# Setting the Stage

## 227

- Phaedrus comes across Socrates and they head outside the city. Are they already outside the city? Maybe, but I think not. Instead Socrates is in the outskirts. (Why?) The ambiguity of scene reminds me of the start of *Gorgias* where it's unclear if they begin in Callicles' house, walk to it after the initial exchange, or are somewhere else.

- In leaving the city, Socrates leaves behind his "natural" habitat of convention, law, *nomos*. He heads out into nature itself. Reminiscent of his arguments with Thrasymachus (in *The Republic*) and Callicles (in the *Gorgias*) who accuse Socrates of equivocating between convention and nature when talking about justice. Are we are leaving behind conventions around *eros* in order to look at the nature of *eros* itself?

- Note the references to Lysias, Cephalus, Epicrates, Morychus, the Piraeus, Olympian Zeus. See the [references doc](./references-and-allusions.md) for more on them.

- Socrates guesses that Phaedrus has been given a "feast of eloquence" by Lysias. Reminiscent of the opening lines of the *Gorgias*: (*Socrates: "Oh? Did we 'arrive when the feast was over,' as the saying goes? Are we late?"*) Socrates tends to be absent from the "feasts" of the rhetoricians and sophists, although in this section of the *Phaedrus* he says of himself (ironically, no doubt) that he is "sick with passion for hearing speeches."

- Lysias has come up to the city from Piraeus: significant? In *The Republic*, Socrates going down to the Piraeus and back up to the city is like descending into and out of the cave. That said, the house Lysias is staying in (owned by Epicrates and formerly by Morychus — see the references doc) suggests enlightenment isn't part of his visit.

- Socrates says he'd walk with Phaedrus as far as Megara and back to hear the speech — that is the city where Lysias later fled to avoid being killed by the Thirty Tyrants. He attributes the regimen to Herodicus, whom he criticizes in The Republic for excesses in exercise (more on him in the [references doc](./references-and-allusions.md)).

- Playful, flirtatious erotic language and wordplay here, and throughout the dialogue. "Show me what you've got in your left hand under your cloak." (Har har.) Socrates won't leave Phaedrus alone until Phaedrus shares the speech — he has the doggedness of a lover described in Lysias' speech.

- Phaedrus says he will recite the speech in the "proper order" — an ironic phrase, since it turns out the speech has no real order at all, being just a series of observations and points about what lovers are like. ("Besides ... besides ... and anyway ... and another point ... another point ...")

- They walk along the river to their chosen spot. Interesting references to Boreas and Orithuia (see references doc). It suggests that rhetoric has an overpowering forecefulness to it, perhaps comparable in some way to rape.

- Socrates explains why he accepts myths: he could dismiss them by coming up with clever stories, but then he'd have a mountain of work to do to explain them all. And it would distract him from his more important task of first knowing himself, taken on in obedience to the Oracle at Delphi. Note that he speaks here of first knowing his own soul before investigating other subjects — advice for the practice of true rhetoric that he will re-iterate later on (271).

    For Socrates, what's less important is the literal truth behind myths and what's more important is ascertaining the truths they convey. He is happy to assume they must contain truth, deferring to ancients for their wisdom in creating and passing on these stories as they are, not esteeming himself
