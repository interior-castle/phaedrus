###Lysias###

Although not present in the dialogue, Lysias looms large. Phaedrus has just come from a visit with Lysias, where he was charmed by a speech, and has a copy of Lysias' speech with him. He's portrayed as a pursuer of Phaedrus.

Lysias was the son of Cephalus and brother of Polemarchus. Cephalus' house was in the Piraeus, the port town connected to Athens (a wall surrounded the city, the port, and the passage between them). Cephalus was from Syracuse but came to Athens at the invitation of Pericles â€” Lysias was born in the Piraeus. Cephalus established a weapons or shield factory that employed 120 skilled laborers, and he was enriched by Athens' wars.

After the death of Cephalus, Polemarchus lived in a house in Athens while Lysias stayed in a house (was this his father's estate?) in the Piraeus near the factory. The Thirty Tyrants sought to punish foreigners, and in addition Lysias was on the side of the Democrats against the Thirty. 

Lysias was a famed orator and we have about 30 of his speeches.
