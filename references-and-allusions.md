# Phaedrus

In addition to his main role in this dialogue, Phaedrus also appears in the *Symposium*, where he gives a speech, and in the *Protragoras*, where he is mentioned as one in the crowd. He is portrayed as a young aristocrat that greatly admires rhetoricians, and perhaps influential in those circles from a young age — the *Protagoras* takes place some 20 years before the other dialogues.

Phaedrus was implicated, along with Alcibiades, in the desecration of the Eleusinian Mysteries in 415 BC, on the night before the disastrous Athenian expedition to Sicily. Phaedrus fled Athens in the wake of the accusation and lost his wealth and property.

# Lysias

Although not present in the dialogue, Lysias looms large. Phaedrus has just come from a visit with Lysias, where he was charmed by a speech, and has a copy of Lysias' speech with him. He's portrayed as a pursuer of Phaedrus.

## Family history (Cephalus)

Lysias was the son of Cephalus and brother of Polemarchus and Euthydemus. Cephalus' house was in Piraeus, the port town connected to Athens (a wall surrounded the city, the port, and the passage between them). Cephalus was from Syracuse but came to Athens at the invitation of Pericles. (Lysias was born in Piraeus but was not a citizen of Athens.) 

Cephalus established a weapons or shield factory that employed 120 skilled laborers, and he was enriched by Athens' wars, especially the disastrous Sicilian Expedition.

After the death of Cephalus, Polemarchus lived in a house in Athens while Lysias stayed in a house (was this his father's estate?) in the Piraeus near the factory. The brothers were wealthy and made significant contributions to the public. The reign of the Thirty Tyrants was a disaster for the family, however. As summarized in Wikipedia (taken from a 19th century dictionary of ancient Greek biographies):

> In 404 BC, the Thirty Tyrants were established at Athens under the protection of a Spartan garrison. One of their earliest measures was an attack upon the resident aliens, who were represented as disaffected to the new government. Lysias and Polemarchus were on a list of ten singled out to be the first victims. Polemarchus was arrested, and compelled to drink hemlock. Lysias had a narrow escape, with the help of a large bribe. He slipped by a back-door out of the house in which he was a prisoner, and took a boat to Megara. 

## Career as a speech writer

Returning from his exile, it appears Lysias was broke — the Thirty having confiscated his property and wealth, it seems — and began writing speeches to make a living. He was prolific, and we have 34 of his speeches plus fragments, although he wrote much more that hasn't survived. The speeches he wrote would have been delivered by someone else, as Lysias was not a citizen and could not speak in the courts.

The most famous of Lysias' surviving speeches is "On the Murder of Eratosthenes," in which a man who killed his wife's adulterous lover defends his action as justifiable homocide. 

Interestingly, among his surviving works are two speeches against Alcibiades, who was a target of Socrates' affections. In the first, he accuses Alcibiades bitterly of numerous crimes, and he reveals that they have been enemies since Lysias' father Cephalus had a dispute with Alcibiades' father Cleinias many years before.

Another famous speech concerns, coincidentally, another Eratosthenes: the man who the Thirty sent to arrest Lysias' brother Polemarchus. "Against Eratosthenes" is an impassioned speech, accusing the man of having murdered Polemarchus and confiscated the family's wealth. It's in this speech that we get crucial biographical details about Cephalus and his sons. Lysias also relates the day of his escape, which included sneaking out of a guarded house when three separate doors happened to be unlocked.

Lysias lived to about the age of 80, dying in 380 BC. (Plato would have been about 50 at the time of Lysias' death.) Scholars' best guess as to the date of *Phaedrus*'s composition puts it around 370 BC.

Lysias is also mentioned in the very short dialogue "Clitophon," which may not have been written by Plato. It's odd and doesn't seem to fit in well with the rest of Plato's corpus. On the other hand, Xenephon appears to have read it and responded in his own work, which was published while Plato was still alive. So even if it wasn't Plato's work, it nevertheless was circulating during his lifetime.

## Polemarchus (257)

Polemarchus features more prominently in *The Republic* than his brothers. Notice that in the *Phaedrus* Socrates says Polemarchus was converted to philosophy — and that he hopes Lysias can be also. 

Euthydemus, the third brother is merely mentioned in the Republic and doesn't appear anywhere else. The Platonic dialogue *Euthydemus* concerns another man, a famous sophist.

# Epicrates and the house of Morychus (227)

Phaedrus mentions (227b) he was visiting Lysias who was staying at Epicrates' house, which used to belong to Morychus.


## Epicrates (227)

Epicrates was a partisan democrat who helped overthrow the Thirty Tyrants. He was then sent on an embassy to the Persian king where he allegedly flattered the king, took money from him, and embezzled public (Athenian) funds. He was tried for corruption multiple times but appears to have escaped conviction and punishment.

Lysias wrote a speech prosecuting Epicrates for corruption and asking the jury not only to convict him but also to be sure they apply the death penalty as punishment.

## Morychus' house next to the temple of Olympian Zeus (227)

Morychus was a tragic poet and contemporary of Aristophanes. He's ridiculed in multiple plays by Aristophanes as being gluttonous and effeminate. There was an ancient Greek proverb, "More foolish than Morychus," but we don't know whether it referenced this Morychus or someone else.

The house of Morychus is said to be next to the temple of Olympian Zeus. The temple was started in 6th century by tyrants but abandoned early in its construction, remaining that way for centuries. Democratic Athens appears to have felt it was hubristic (it would have been Greece's largest temple) and they did not work on it. Aristotle cites it as an example of a public project by tyrants meant to keep people poor, occupied, and unable to form resistance.

# Acumenus and Eryximachus (227 & 268)

Acumenus was a 5th century doctor. Phaedrus calls him a mutual friend when speaking to Socrates at 227.

Acumenus was the father of Eryximachus, also a doctor, who has a speaking part in the *Symposium*. Eryximachus appears to have been a lover of Phaedrus. He's mentioned at 268 along with his father.

# Herodicus (227)

Socrates says he'd walk with Phaedrus as far as Megara and back to hear the speech. He attributes the walk to Megara as advice from Herodicus, a physician (and physical trainer, and sophist) whose regimen Socrates criticizes in *The Republic* (406a-b):

> "Herodicus was a trainer and became a valetudinarian, and blended gymnastics and medicine, for the torment first and chiefly of himself and then of many successors." "How so?" he said. "By lingering out his death," said I; "for living in perpetual observance of his malady, which was incurable, he was not able to effect a cure, but lived through his days unfit for the business of life, suffering the tortures of the damned if he departed a whit from his fixed regimen, and struggling against death by reason of his science he won the prize of a doting old age."

The distance from Athens to Megara and back was ~50 miles. Hippocrates, a student of Herodicus, mentions (satirically?) that Herodicus killed fever patients by running exercises. Aristotle comments in his book on rhetoric that Herodicus was healthy but at the expense of any human pleasure, and therefore he wasn't happy in regard to health.

# Ilisus, Boreas, Orithuia (229)

The Ilisus was a small tributary that ran beside Athens. Today it is channeled almost entirely underground, built over by the city.

According to a legend, Orithuia was the daughter of the Athenian king Erechtheus. She was playing with nymphs along the bank of the river and was abducted by Boreas, the personification of the north wind. This appears to be a rape/marriage situation. 

The force of the wind and abduction could be seen as symbolic of or a reference to the force of rhetoric, or perhaps the violent side of erotic desire.

It is elsewhere reported that she became, by Boreas, the mother of four children, two of whom were the "Boreads," brothers with special powers — wings and the ability to fly — and were Argonauts. Interesting legend regarding one of the brothers (from Wikipedia): "Calais in one tradition is said to be the beloved of Orpheus; Orpheus was said to have been killed at the hands of jealous Thracian women whilst he wandered the countryside thinking of Calais."

There are many legends surrounding Erechtheus (aka Erichthonius). Not many seem like they could be related to the *Phaedrus*, although according to Diodorus, Erechtheus was an Egyptian who among other things brought the Eleusinian mysteries to Athens.

# Isocrates (279)

Isocrates is called beautiful and a friend of Socrates in this dialogue. In history, he was the son of a wealthy man who had all the top sophists/rhetoricians, as well Socrates, tutor him. He had a timid character, and his rhetoric and speeches are characterized as being less political in nature (insofar as he was not a major player in the big political issues of his day) and more concerned with eloquence and ethics. He made a fortune as a teacher of rhetoric and as a speechwriter.

Isocrates famously critiques the rhetoricians of his day for not making moral education part and parcel of their schools.

He is praised for his clear thinking and composition, perhaps qualities Plato intends to contrast with Lysias' "and another thing ..." style.

Socrates' prediction of Isocrates' later success seems to convey Plato's approval or fondness of him. Although prompted by Phaedrus to talk about Isocrates, Socrates' endorsement seems to come out of nowhere.
